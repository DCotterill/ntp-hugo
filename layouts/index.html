                        <p>
                        I started Happy Green Sprout to help educate and coach people to feel happier and healthier
                        using nutrition and dietary change, as well as all other lifestyle factors.
                        </p>
                        <p>My philosophy is to help you make small incremental changes, creating healthy habits you
                            can sustain for a lifetime.</p>
                        <p>
                        I specialise in perimenopause and hormonal balance, as I recognise that so many women are
                            not getting the information they need to improve their symptoms.</p>

                <h2>Advice for Individuals</h2>

                <p>Are you struggling with your health? Are you ready to make the changes so you can feel better every day?</p>

                <p>As a functional nutritionist, my focus is on partnering with individuals to make positive changes in
                    their health and overall wellbeing through personalised lifestyle adjustments and nutritional
                    guidance. In particular, I have a specialisation in addressing perimenopause, menopause, and
                    hormone health concerns.</p>

                <p>Nutritional Therapy can assist with alleviating a variety of symptoms and chronic illnesses and
                    can help you optimise your health, get back to feeling good and:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Sleep better</li>
                        <li>Have more energy</li>
                        <li>Improve overall health, well being and mindset.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>I work with people one-on-one to look at what elements of their life they can change to help them improve
                    their health and feel good. Because I believe if we can change small things in our lives and focus on
                    the right things, we can live more and fully enjoy our life.</p>
