Ever since I realised that I am sensitive to dairy products – and cream in particular – I’ve been trying to dream up alternatives to cheesecake as I love cheesecake and it has been my go-to dessert for Christmas for quite a few years now. I haven’t found a true replacement recipe for cheesecake (watch this space on that one) but for now, here are my cheesecake bliss balls that can serve as a bite-sized ball of lemony magic.
 
This recipe is good for someone with a dairy intolerance who loves cheesecake (pretty much me!). As it contains sugar in the form of maple syrup it wouldn’t suit someone totally excluding all forms of sugar, but could be used during maintenance as a healthy treat.
 
Makes: 32

__Ingredients__
 
What goes into the food processor:

* Lemon zest of 2 lemons
* Lemon juice of 2 lemons
* 250g of Cashew Nuts
* 75g of shredded coconut
* 1/4 cup of maple syrup
* 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of coconut oil (melted)
* 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric powder or freshly chopped turmeric
 
For rolling:

* 1/4 to 1/2 a cup of desiccated coconut for rolling the balls
 
__Preparation:__

* Prep time: 10-20 minutes
* Allow yourself: 1 hour
 
Put all the ingredients into a food processor and blend until mostly uniform (a few chunks is fine). Put into the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up and help with rolling the balls. Roll into balls and coat in the desiccated coconut.
