Banana bread was a big staple in my house when I was a kid. My mum made it often when we had black bananas...I wanted to come up with a healthier version. This one still has its fair share of sugar, but also incorporates some nutritious ingredients with good fats - almond meal, eggs and coconut oil. My kids won’t eat anything if it tastes too healthy - and this tastes just like normal banana bread so it’s great for those fussy kids in the family! My kids honestly tell me this is the yummiest banana bread that they’ve ever tasted. I’ve also been known to add in some dark chocolate chips or cacao nibs for some extra yumminess.

Sometimes we are looking for a healthier snack, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it has to be the absolutely healthiest thing that they’ve ever eaten. It can be something that fits the category of ‘healthier than they would normally eat’. So be aware, this food is calorie dense, but for a growing toddler, a picky eater or a teenager who you can never fill up it’s a great option that will keep them coming back for more.
