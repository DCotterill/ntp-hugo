I love making hummus. It’s so easy to whip it up in the food processor and far more nutritious if you make it from scratch. By putting together real food ingredients and taking away the preservatives you'd get in a store bought hummus, it's a bit of a no brainer and it only takes 10 minutes to throw together. Anyone that is a regular at our house parties knows that I tend to make two different hummus varieties at the same time - I make a double batch of the basic hummus recipe below and then I serve half as the first hummus recipe with jalapenos (Darren’s favourite) and then I add beetroot to the blender and make a pink beetroot hummus topped with some grated/chopped up beets. I always tend to make this with one raw beetroot for a better nutrient profile but in a pinch I will use tinned beetroot. Once made up, I sprinkle the top with some beetroot strips or jalapenos and a drizzle of olive oil. There are so many variations to this recipe and you can easily make up your own. As a few other suggestions, why not try:

* Roasted vegetables such as capsicum, carrots, zucchini with smokey paprika
* Toasted pumpkin seeds (pepitas)
* Toasted pine nuts
* Chopped kalamata or green olives
* Chopped jalapenos and drizzle of olive oil

Outside of entertaining it's a great snack for the kids...my daughter won't eat carrots without my special homemade hummus!


**Nutrient Profile**

Chickpeas are a good source of phytoestrogen, a plant compound capable of binding to oestrogen receptors. By doing so, it can help to reduce some of the symptoms of perimenopause, as oestrogen production goes down. This recipe is also a great source of Calcium, Zinc, Manganese, Copper and a variety of other trace minerals. You'll also find Vitamins E, K, C and a wide variety of B vitamins as well as a healthy dose of good fats and plenty of fibre.

Makes: 2 generous bowls

__Ingredients__
 
* 1 can chickpeas, drained
* 1½ tablespoons gluten-free tahini
* 1 clove garlic, crushed
* 2 tablespoons of olive oil (then continue adding to taste)
* ½ teaspoon salt
* Black pepper to taste
* 2 tablespoons of lemon juice (then continue adding to taste)

__Preparation:__

Prep time: 10 minutes

 
Add chickpeas and all the other ingredients through to the lemon juice. Blend until it comes to a smooth consistency. Conduct a taste test and then add additional lemon juice and olive oil to ensure you get the right taste and consistency. 

Beetroot version: Add 1/2 to 1 raw beet to the food processor with the other ingredients above and blend until smooth (or a few beet chunks). Cut into  1/2 inch cubes prior to blending. For the topping add grated beet and a drizzle of olive oil and black pepper. 

Other example toppings:

* Pumpkin/pepita seeds: Add 1 -2 tsp of toasted Pumpkin Pepitas to taste and a drizzle of olive oil (toast quickly in a frying pan, or roast quickly in the oven).

* Jalapenos: Add chopped pickled jalapenos and a drizzle of olive oil to taste.

* Olives: Add chopped olives, either green or kalamata and drizzle with olive oil to taste.
