I learnt about this recipe from my friend Josh when we visited our friends and family in the UK and he whipped up a batch to help cure our hangovers in the morning (Thanks Josh!). Finally I'd found something for Darren to eat for breakfast that contains eggs. Darren is a very hard person to cook brunch for. Can you believe that he won’t eat omelette, poached eggs, boiled eggs, fried eggs or even french toast. What’s a girl to do? He doesn’t even really like bacon or sausages that much, so when I’m trying to encourage him to eat a protein focused breakfast it makes it tough. 

Eggs are rich in essential nutrients that contribute to overall health and well-being. Here are some key nutrients you can find in eggs:

* Protein: Eggs are an excellent source of high-quality protein. The protein in eggs contains all the essential amino acids that your body needs to build and repair tissues.
* Vitamin B12: Essential for nerve function and the formation of red blood cells.
* Vitamin D: Important for bone health, immune function, and various metabolic processes.
* Vitamin A: Beneficial for eye health, skin health, and immune function.
* Minerals including Selenium, Phosphorus, Iron
* Choline: Eggs are one of the best dietary sources of choline, a nutrient that plays a vital role in brain health and development, as well as liver function.
* Lutein and Zeaxanthin are antioxidants that are beneficial for eye health, particularly in reducing the risk of age-related macular degeneration.
* Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Eggs enriched with omega-3 fatty acids can contribute to heart health by promoting healthy cholesterol levels and reducing inflammation.

It's worth noting that the nutrient content of an egg can vary based on factors such as the hen's diet and the way the egg is cooked. A large boiled egg contains approximately:

* 6 grams of protein
* 5 grams of healthy fats
* 70 calories

So if you know someone who doesn’t like eggs or you know a vegetarian who finds it hard to get enough B12, these fritters could be a good way to go. 

 
Makes: 40 patties (serves 8-10 people)

__Ingredients__
 
* 2 medium zucchinis
* 2 carrots
* 1/2 - 1 onion
* 2 mushrooms
* 1/8 red capsicum
* 1/2 a birds eye chili (optional)
* 180g of halloumi
* Handful of parsley - chopped (or other fresh herbs)
* Ground black pepper
* 4 eggs
* 1 and 1/4 cups of gluten-free flour
* 2 Tablespoons of olive oil for frying

 
Optional:

* a dose of sesame seeds, herbs or seaweed to sprinkle on top and a side of tomato and avocado salad.
 
__Preparation:__

* Allow yourself: 45 minutes
 
Chop the zucchini, carrot and capsicum into big chunks and then add to a food processor and process it into small chunks.
Strain the mixture to remove any excess liquid through a cheesecloth or teatowel. Once strained, add to a mixing bowl. Add the onion, mushrooms and halloumi to the food processor and process it into small chunks and then add that to the mixing bowl with the zucchini, carrot, capsicum, herbs and black pepper. Add in the eggs and flour and then mix it together. If it’s a bit too wet, add in more flour until a good consistency to make patties. Heat up the frying pan and once hot make into patties as you go. Fry in a pan until golden brown on both sides, roughly 2-3 minutes per side. 

__Tips for batch cooking:__

If I’m cooking this recipe for a group of friends and/or relatives (holiday brunch, Christmas Day brekkie for example) then I tend to cook it all up in batches in the frying pan, then pop it into the oven to keep them warm whilst I’m cooking up the rest of the fritters and the rest of the meal. Once they are fried up, you can store them in the fridge as fritters and then warm them up in the oven, microwave or even reheat them in the pan as you need them. Alternatively you can cook up whatever you want to eat and then store the uncooked mixture in a glass jar for up to 3 days. I also drizzle olive oil on the top of the glass jar mixture for storage, to stop the oxidation of the surface of the mixture.
