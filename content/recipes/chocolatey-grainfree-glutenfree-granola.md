I picked up this recipe a fews years back from Sarah Wilson’s I quit sugar website, but have put a bit of a twist on it by adding in cacao for extra antioxidants and chocolate flavour. I eat it for breakfast or even as an evening snack if I get the munchies and personally pair it with Greek full-fat yoghurt but it would be great with kefir or a coconut yoghurt too. I also like to sprinkle a few fresh berries on the top if I have them in the fridge. It’s energy dense so I try to watch the portion size. 

The granola is shown here with a small serving of greek yoghurt as well as fresh blueberries and strawberries - my favourite way to serve it!

Makes: 6-10 Servings

__Ingredients__
 
* 2 cups of mixed nuts (Almonds, Hazlenuts, Cashew nuts etc.)
* 3 cups of coconut flakes or coconut chips
* 2 tablespoons of chia seeds
* 1 tablespoon of raw organic cacao powder
* 1 tablespoon of pumpkin seeds
* 1 teaspoon of cinnamon(optional)
* 1/4 cup of coconut oil 

__Preparation:__

* Prep time: 5-10 minutes
* Total time including baking: 30-40 minutes
 
Put the oven on 120 ℃ to warm up and put coconut oil in a saucepan on the hob to melt it if necessary. Meanwhile roughly chop the mixed nuts, leaving a few whole, as desired. Put all the ingredients in a bowl and mix them up with the melted coconut oil. Line a baking tray with baking paper and spread the mixture evenly and put into the oven for 15-20 minutes, turning every 5-10 minutes so that you can check it doesn't burn. Once it's as crunchy as you desire (usually starting to turn a brown), remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking tray before transferring to a mason jar for storage.
