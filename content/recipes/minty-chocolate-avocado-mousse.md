I’ve been playing around with this recipe for a while. Avocados are a great source of monounsaturated fat and fibre, and also contain a wide variety of nutrients, including 20 different vitamins and minerals. 

Knowing that they are super nutrient dense I find it frustrating that it’s hard to get anyone in my house to eat more than a smear of it on a sandwich.  I also personally find it hard to eat a lot of avocado in one sitting as it can be pretty rich, a characteristic that actually works really well for this recipe.

The main recipe here is for a mint chocolate mousse that my whole family enjoys, but you might want to try the cayenne pepper version below if you like something with a spicy kick. Both recipes are dairy-free, gluten free, vegan and can be whipped up in 10 minutes. 

I often eat it as a snack if I have a sugar craving in the afternoon, or I have whipped it up quickly to take as a dessert to take for dinner parties with a variety of fruit and nuts that pair well with this dessert. See the serving suggestions below for ideas on what you can serve it with. 

 
Makes: 4 portions

__Ingredients__
 
* 1 ripe avocado
* 1/3 cup organic raw cacao powder
* 1/3 cup full fat organic coconut cream (can be substituted with coconut yoghurt)
* 1/4 cup organic maple syrup (to taste)
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon organic vanilla essence
* 1 teaspoon mint essence

__Chili Chocolate Mousse Alternative__

Instead of the mint essence you can add 1/8 of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a fiery alternative.

 
__Preparation ( ~10 minutes)__

* Combine all ingredients in a food processor or high-powered blender and process until completely smooth
* Grab a spoon and taste test. If it’s too bitter add a bit more maple syrup or coconut cream. If it’s too sweet, sprinkle in a bit more cacao powder. Blend and taste test again
* Spoon into 4 small bowls or one larger glass container for storage
* Chill until set and serve

__Serving Suggestions__

It tastes amazing by itself, but you might want to add:

* Berries - blueberries, raspberries or blackberries 
* Nuts, either raw or roasted - hazelnuts, almonds, macadamia nuts, brazil nuts
* My chocolatey granola recipe also pairs really well with this mousse
