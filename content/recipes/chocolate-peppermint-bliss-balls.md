I've been making these bliss balls for a really long time and they are well loved in our house - even with my kids who both proclaim to not like dried fruit - I must admit I've never really told them what's in them, just that they taste like peppermint chocolate and that is good enough for them! I've adapted the recipe from a similar recipe from the [Paleo Princess](http://www.paleoprincess.com.au/). She has some great recipes so check her out if you're looking for different recipe ideas.
 
As well as being a healthier treat, this recipe is good for someone who is looking for a natural energy boost that provides both carbs and fat whilst endurance training. My husband incorporated them into his training and race day nutrition for a 100km Ultramarathon and calculated that they have around 95kCal per bliss ball. Way better than sugary running gels, easier on the stomach and a better balance of carbs, protein and fat. We also take a few with us if we are going on a bush walk or trail run - they keep the kids moving when they start to flag and tell us they need to stop for a break!

The key thing to remember if you want to make this recipe is to soak your almonds the night before you make it - I've been caught out with that a few times in the past! So set an alarm to remind you at around 9pm and you can make them when you wake up. Or alternatively start them soaking in the morning before you go to work and they'll be prepped and ready to go when you get home.

Makes: 60 Servings

__Ingredients__
 
What goes into the food processor:

* 1 3/4 cups almonds (soaked overnight)
* 2 cups of pitted dates (soaked for 15 minutes in hot water)
* 2/3 cup of raw cacao powder
* 1 cup of shredded coconut
* 3 tsp of mint essence
* 1 tsp of vanilla essence
* 2/3 of a cup of coconut oil (melted)

 
For rolling:

* 1/4 to 1/2 a cup of desiccated coconut for rolling the balls
 
__Preparation:__

* Prep time: 20-30 minutes
* Soak the almonds ahead of time
 
Ahead of time put the almonds into a bowl and cover with cold water and allow to soak for ~12 hours. When your almonds are presoaked, take the dates and put them in a separate bowl, and cover with boiling water and soak for 15 minutes. After soaking drain both the almonds and the dates and add them to the food processor. Add the rest of the ingredients into a food processor (cacao, shredded coconut, coconut oil, vanilla and mint essences) and blend until mostly smooth. Roll into balls and coat in the desiccated coconut.
