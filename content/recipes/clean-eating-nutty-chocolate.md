This is a great option if you are looking for a healthier alternative when that 2.30pm feeling for something sweet really hits. You can make this recipe as a plain ‘chocolate’ with no chunky ingredients, and if you do it only takes 5 minutes to combine the ingredients. Or, you can combine it together with a variety of different nuts, seeds or coconut to give it an extra crunch. This recipe suggests roasting your seeds and nuts - which is really yummy - but you could easily use raw nuts or activated nuts instead, which would be more nutrient dense. It’s calorie dense so a little goes a long way. I break it up into different sizes so I can choose a piece that fits my appetite on the day.

 
Makes: 20-25 portions

__Ingredients__
 
Raw Ingredients:

* 1/2 cup of almond butter
* 3 tablespoons of coconut oil (melted)
* 1/3 cup of cacao powder
* 2 teaspoons of maple syrup (or to taste)
* 1 teaspoon of vanilla essence (or to taste)

 
For Roasting:

* 1/2 cup to 1 cup of nuts / seeds / coconut can be added - I roasted almonds and hazelnuts for the batch shown in the picture above
* 1 teaspoon of coconut oil
 
__Preparation:__

* Prep time: ~25 minutes
 
Chop your nuts into rough slices and/or chunks and lay on a baking tray lined with baking paper and a teaspoon of coconut oil and bake at 150&deg;C or 300&deg;F for 15 - 20 minutes. Keep an eye on them and remove when they are starting to turn a golden brown. Allow to cool.

Melt the coconut oil if necessary and add the almond butter, cacao powder, maple syrup and vanilla essence as well as half the chopped nuts. Mix thoroughly. Taste test the mix and add more sweetener or vanilla essence to your own taste. 
Line a baking tray and pour the mix into the tray, then sprinkle the remaining roasted nuts on the top.
Put the baking tray into the freezer to cool and go hard. Once frozen break up with a knife, store in a container and return to the freezer. Freezer storage is required as it quickly melts at room temperature.
