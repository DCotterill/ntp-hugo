These kale chips were a great discovery. Super easy to make, with very little prep, you can have some yummy nutritious hot snacks for the kids (big or little) to snack on in less than 15 minutes. I’ve converted non-kale lovers with this recipe and highly recommend giving them a go. They are great to make when you’re going to have the oven on anyway, for example when you are roasting some veg or cooking a casserole. I also make them when I have a lot of hungry snackers in the house and I want them to eat something a bit more nutritious than normal - or just when I have a whole heap of kale left over from a recipe - I promise you there will not be any left after you make these babies! I usually end up making about 3 to 4 trays of them as everyone is happy to keep chomping on them in a never ending fashion...a fantastic snackfest.




__Ingredients__
 

* Kale - big bunch
* 2 tablespoons of olive oil
* Teaspoon of salt

 
__Preparation:__

 
1. Heat the oven to 175&deg;C. Line a baking sheet with baking paper.
2. Cut the kale away from the thick stem and cut it roughly into bite sized squares. Wash in a colander and either spin in a salad spinner or dry it with paper towel. Place in a bowl, add the olive oil and salt and stir until the leaves are roughly coated with the oil.
3. Bake the kale in the oven for 10-15 minutes until it is slightly brown around the edges but not burnt. Check regularly and give it a shake to ensure even cooking throughout.
4. Serve immediately.
