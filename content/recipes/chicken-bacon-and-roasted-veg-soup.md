I came up with this recipe whilst trying to dream up a way of increasing the amount of prebiotic foods in my diet, which is important when you are avoiding gluten as people tend to reduce the amount of fibre in their diet when they are going gluten-free.
 
This recipe would also be good for someone who might have taken antibiotics recently as it has a stack of prebiotic foods (all of those yummy root vegetables) or anyone who wants to be able do some bulk cooking at the weekend and make up a stack of yummy lunches to take to work or for a light dinner when you get home from work.
 
Makes: 4-6 portions (depending on your size and appetite)

__Ingredients__
 
* 1 x Red onion
* 2 x Garlic cloves
* 1 x Turnip
* 1 fennel bulb
* Purple sweet potato
* Parsnip
* 3 carrots
* 1.25 Litre of organic home-made chicken stock
* Fennel Seeds, salt and pepper
* 6 slices of short cut bacon
* Roast chicken meat (I use leftovers from our roast dinners)
* Various fats for frying, roasting/baking

 
Optional:

* a dose of olive oil, seeds, herbs or seaweed to sprinkle on top
 
__Preparation:__

* Allow yourself: 1 hour
 
Chop the turnip, purple sweet potato, parsnips and carrots in to bite sized chunks, place them on a baking tray and coat in olive oil and put into the oven at 190&deg;C to roast. Cook for 20-30 minutes, checking regularly. 

Whilst the veggies are roasting add ghee or coconut oil to the soup pan and fry the bacon, then remove from the pan and reserve for later. Chop onion, garlic and fennel bulb and fry in ghee until golden brown. Then add the chicken stock to the pan and warm through. Once it starts to simmer, turn off the hob and allow to cool, then blend with a hand blender. Now return to the hob and simmer whilst waiting for the vegetables to roast in the oven. Once the veg is roasted, add the roasted veg, roast chicken and bacon. Warm through and serve and serve with a few fennel fronds or another garnishes to increase the nutrient density.
