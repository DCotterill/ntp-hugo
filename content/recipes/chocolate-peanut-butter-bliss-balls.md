I love Snickers bars. That irresistible combination of peanut and chocolate together! 

Well here is my healthier version with mostly raw ingredients. They are still a treat, and have a high sugar content, but if you are looking for a higher calorie snack to take on a trail run or to give to the kids as an after school snack these could be a great go-to. Or if you crave that salty, peanutty chocolatey goodness and want a better option they might help get you out of a tight spot. 

Oh and the yummy balls name comes courtesy of my 10yo - she’s often asking me to ‘make me some yummy balls please!’

 
Makes: 40-50 bliss balls

__Ingredients__
 
Raw Ingredients:

* 1 cup of pitted dates
* 3 tablespoons of cacao powder
* 4 tablespoons of peanut butter (100% peanuts, no other ingredients)
* 1 teaspoons of vanilla essence
* 2 1/2 a tablespoon of coconut oil
* 1-2 teaspoons of water to make into more of a paste (if needed)
* 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cup of raw almonds (you can also sub for some hazelnuts, I did 1 cup almonds, 1/4 cup hazelnuts for my last batch)
* 3 tablespoons of maple syrup

 
__Preparation:__

* Prep time: ~25 minutes
 
Soak the dates for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the coconut oil in a saucepan on the hob if necessary. Drain the dates and add them to the food processor. Then add the cacao powder, peanut butter, vanilla essence and coconut oil to the food processor and blend until it becomes a paste. If it looks a bit dry you can add 1-2 teaspoons of water gradually to make it a bit more moist. Then add almonds and maple syrup and blend again until it looks uniform, but with still some chunks of almonds in it. Form the mixture into balls and place in the fridge to cool and for storage. You can also roll the balls in crushed peanuts for a more nutty experience.

__Other tips__

Best stored in the fridge for up to 7 days

You can easily make a half batch in a small food processor, just roughly half the ingredients:

* 1/2 cup of pitted dates (soaked)
* 1 1/2 tablespoons of cacao powder
* 2 tablespoons of peanut butter
* 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla essence
* 1 tablespoon of coconut oil
* Up to 1 teaspoon of water (if needed)
* 3/4 cup of almonds
* 1 1/2 tablespoons of maple syrup
