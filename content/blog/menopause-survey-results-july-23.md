I'm pleased to share some findings from my recent survey on menopause symptoms. Thank you to all the people who contributed their personal perspectives.

Although we are well into the 21st century and we’ve managed to eliminate a lot of the taboos in our society, menopause still seems to be one area that doesn’t get a lot of press, and unsurprisingly women are finding themselves taken aback when the symptoms do hit. 

In a lot of cases no one has warned them of the effects of menopause and how in some cases the effects can be debilitating and affect our day to day, in ways we would never have imagined. Here are the results of the survey:

__Most prevalent symptoms:__

I was surprised to see brain fog and memory issues come in first, with 23 out of the 29 perimenopausal women who responded experiencing these issues. It doesn't seem to be a symptom many people in the general public would associate with menopause, and I think it could be a symptom that we personally don’t want to admit to others. 

Unsurprisingly hot flushes and weight gain feature heavily in the responses. The good news that these are relatively well understood and there are known ways to help these symptoms.

__Total number of symptoms per person:__

On average, those in the perimenopausal stage are showing between 6 and 7 symptoms, although as you can see above the number of symptoms per person vary from 2 to 12 out of the 13 symptoms we presented. Symptom numbers will vary heavily depending on where an individual is on their perimenopausal journey, starting off with a few and gaining momentum in the middle of the transition. Even in menopause (>1 year since your last period) you may still experience symptoms related to the perimenopause transition and some women will experience hot flushes into their 70’s and even 80’s for example. 

__What topics are people most interested in?__

Clearly there is a strong interest in what natural supplements and food choices we can make to assist with reducing our symptoms, which is great to see. It’s interesting to note that whilst sleep hygiene and movement and strength were lowest on the list, both feature heavily in ways that we can influence both weight management and also managing our moods. For example, increasing the amount of weight bearing exercise that we do can increase lean muscle mass, something that is a key feature of any weight management approach that we would recommend for someone 40 plus. This is a key area I help my clients with as it’s often overlooked, and people don’t know where to start.

__And finally here are a few comments that were made in the survey on what is working for you, to improve your symptoms:__


_'Magnesium and Vitamin D supplements, weighted bamboo blanket has been a sleep game changer'_

_'Medicinal mushrooms, I’ve just started so can’t fully say but definitely help with the sleep issues.'_

_'I quit alcohol and it changed everything.'_

_'Supporting liver, alcohol makes it all worse, reducing stress, Magnesium and liver cleansing teas'_

_'Exercising certainly helps a lot with overall well-being.'_

_'I have been able to balance my mood more with yoga and mindfulness. Which I found to be surprisingly effective.'_


There are certainly a few pearls of wisdom in there, and perhaps a few things to explore for ourselves, to see how it might suit our own individual circumstances and symptoms. 

__Are you interesting in improving your own symptoms?__

Don’t eat too late into the evening, you need to give your body a break and allow it to rest. 

You should try to stop eating or drinking 2 hours before you go to sleep to allow your body to focus on healing your body overnight, rather than still having to digest if you are late night snacking. I recommend taking a 12 hour break from food and drinks between 8pm to 8am every day. 

If you find yourself eating or drinking late a night, it might be possible to have a lie in and skip breakfast instead.

And speaking of sleep…


__Prioritise your sleep__

Sleep is so important for us. Sleeping is when the body heals, it’s critical for good physical and mental health and can improve our hormone regulation, mood and energy.  If you want to read more about the importance of sleep I’d highly recommend Matt Walker’s book: [Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep)


__Consider some supplementation__

Alcohol, sugar and processed foods put a huge strain on the liver and deplete the body of a variety of vitamins and minerals, particularly B vitamins and magnesium. Consider adding in a quality multivitamin and / or magnesium.


__Find some time for exercise__

The run up to Christmas can be a pretty busy time for most of us, but in that time between Christmas Day and New Years Eve we can find we actually have a bit more time on our hands than we normally do. Especially if you’re in lockdown and can’t really go anywhere right now.

It could be the time to start a new exercise habit, perhaps 15 minutes of home-based yoga every day, 10 minutes of weights each day or trying to beat your own personal plank record whilst watching telly. Anything you do will be a benefit, you’ll most likely find it fun, and it could form a healthy habit that continues into 2021.

It’s also worth thinking of some family fun that gets your pulse racing - maybe Boxing Day cricket, a family game of pool volleyball or just a dance around the lounge room to get the blood pumping. So if the kids ask you to join in with their basketball game this Christmas, think twice before you say no.

__And finally...__

Most of all have fun over your break, and if possible make the most of spending time with people you love. If you can make just a little time to think of your own health and fit in some of my tips, it'll definitely help you in the long run. 

Wishing you all a Happy Christmas and a Fantastically Healthy New Year!
