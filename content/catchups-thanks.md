# Thank you!

I’ll be in touch soon via email with the details of our next catch ups.

## Looking for more help with your symptoms?

In my nutrition practice I specialise in helping women to relieve their menopause symptoms 
through natural remedies, food and changing habits to improve your health. If you’re keen to get 
one-on-one advice about how to improve your menopause symptoms, you can book a free first call with me 
to help understand your needs and how I could help. 

Or you can visit my ‘Work With Me’ page to find out more about my services.

## Join the Facebook Group

I’ve also created a Facebook group to help with the organisation of local social catch ups here on the lower North Shore
and Northern Beaches of Sydney, so we can chat about and share our experiences of both perimenopause and menopause 
and support each other along the way.
