                <p>Are you struggling with your health?  Are you ready to make the changes so you can feel better every day?</p>

                <p>I don’t treat or diagnose, but I work with people who have a chronic illness
   or prior diagnosis where they aren’t feeling their best so that we can
                    work on their diet, stress levels and sleep as well as
                    other factors to help improve their lifestyle and help
                    you to be a happier, healthier you.</p>
                <p>Do you:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Live life with constant pain</li>
                        <li>Have an inability to lose weight, even when you feel like you’re
                            doing all the right things</li>
                        <li>Feel like your hormones are out of whack</li>
                        <li>Feel like you’re experiencing the onset of menopause, feeling all the
                            effects and want to reduce the array of symptoms?</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Or you could be suffering from lupus, chronic arthritis, an
                    autoimmune disease and by focusing on optimising your
                    health you can get back to feeling good and:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Sleep better</li>
                        <li>Have more energy</li>
                        <li>Reduce your symptoms</li>
                        <li>Improve overall health, well being and mindset</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I work with people one-on-one to look at what elements
                       of their life they can change to help them improve their health and feel good. Because I believe if we can change small things in our lives and focus on the right things, we can live more and enjoy life to the fullest.
                    </p>

                        <p>By focusing on nutrient density for every meal, you
                            can ensure that your body has everything it needs to live your best life. You need the right balance of micronutrients and macronutrients to ensure that you are able to deal with the challenges that you are faced with now and in the future.

Cortisol is known as the fight or flight hormone, and is released by the adrenal glands in times of high stress and/or emergency. In Hunter-Gatherer times, the ‘fight or flight’ response was activated when fleeing from a dangerous situation, such as being chased by a wild animal.</p>
