                <h2>My why</h2>
                <p>Monday, Aug 19, 2019</p>
                <div class="blog-content"><p>Hi, I’m Diane Cotterill and I live in Sydney on the Northern Beaches with my husband and two kids. I’m passionate about improving health through nutrition, eating whole foods and a variety of herbs and spices to maximize health and longevity, whilst having fun and enjoying life along the way. I love finding food hacks for quick nutritional wins as well as incrementally improving food choices everyday for both my family and my clients. Currently I’m studying to become a Nutritional Therapy Practitioner and I’d love to help you on your journey to a longer, healthier  and happy life.</p>

<p><strong>So how did I come to be here?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve had a passion for nutrition and how it can affect health since I did my degree in Biochemistry in Manchester in the 90’s. After graduation I developed a career in recruitment, however I&rsquo;ve always continued to be interested in how food and nutrition can affect the way we feel and help us to feel great if we get the balance right. Spurred on by the development of my own share of digestive issues including parasites and IBS type symptoms I have been lead further down the path of learning about nutritional and natural remedies. Last year I decided to further my study and find out about the latest research and science around nutrition and other natural ways of healing and optimizing our health through whole foods and lifestyle changes.</p>

<p>The world of research is progressing at such a fast pace, with government guidelines and traditional medicine struggling to keep pace with the latest research. I’m keen to help people to understand the latest research and scientific findings and how that information could have profound implications for our daily lives. As examples there is so many new findings around lipids/fats, fasting, cholesterol, and the importance or effect of various vitamins and minerals. I am constantly reading up about the new scientific findings and how we can apply them to our everyday lives, and support the healing of our bodies.</p>

<p>I have a particular interest around reversing diabetes and preventing diabetes through ketogenic diets and fasting protocols, but I’d also love to help people with IBS through the fodmap approach and also assist people with improving their longevity and health into old age – it really doesn’t stop there though as I can help people with a wide range of issues. If you&rsquo;re interested to chat then please get in touch.</p>
