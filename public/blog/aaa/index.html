          <h2>Monday, Aug 19, 2019</h2>
          <div><p>I just returned from Washington, DC to attend the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ Food &amp; Nutrition Conference &amp; Expo (FNCE).  It was a particularly good conference, full of excellent presentations on some of today’s hottest nutrition topics, including debates on intermittent fasting vs. calorie restrictions, and weight management vs. Health at Every Size (which rejects weight as a measure of success) — which I’ll address in a future post.  I also enjoyed the sessions focused on nutrition communications, including a tremendous panel on food porn and a session I moderated on mastering video — featuring a trio of dynamite RDNs:  Ellie Krieger, Regan Miller Jones and Manuel Villacorta.</p>

<p>Once again, the exhibit floor was full of new products from a range of exhibitors, including large CPG companies and smaller brands in the natural/organic arena.  Here are seven of the top food trends I spotted:</p>

<p><strong>Digestive Wellness and Gut-Friendly Foods</strong></p>

<p>Gut health was a mega trend at FNCE, as evidenced by the Healthy Gut Pavilion at the expo.  The exhibitors showcased an array of products — from probiotics in many forms (including beyond dairy), gluten-free items and foods low in FODMAPs, an acronym for Fermentable Oligoaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccarides and Polyols — short-chain carbohydrates and sugar alcohols that may be poorly absorbed and trigger IBS and other digestive discomforts for some people. Low-FODMAP foods have been trending for awhile, but expect this category to get even bigger.  Some of the brands included Fody, Fodmapped, Rachel Paul’s Foods, and Lo-Fo Pantry, the first line of low-FODMAP flours and baking mixes.  Even Prego has released a low-FODMAP pasta sauce.  Because this trend is getting so big, there are now programs that will certify low-FODMAP foods.  Two of these programs were at the expo:  Monash University and the FODMAP Friendly certification program.</p>
