      <title>Too easy hummus</title>

      <description>I love making hummus. It’s so easy to whip it up in the food processor and far more nutritious if you make it from scratch. By putting together real food ingredients and taking away the preservatives you&amp;rsquo;d get in a store bought hummus, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a no brainer and it only takes 10 minutes to throw together.</description>

      <title>They won’t even know it’s... gluten free Banana Bread</title>

      <description>Banana bread was a big staple in my house when I was a kid. My mum made it often when we had black bananas&amp;hellip;I wanted to come up with a healthier version. This one still has its fair share of sugar, but also incorporates some nutritious ingredients with good fats - almond meal, eggs and coconut oil.</description>

      <title>Kale chips, baked not fried!</title>

      <description>These kale chips were a great discovery. Super easy to make, with very little prep, you can have some yummy nutritious hot snacks for the kids (big or little) to snack on in less than 15 minutes. I’ve converted non-kale lovers with this recipe and highly recommend giving them a go.</description>

      <title>Minty Chocolate Avocado Mousse</title>
      <link>https://laughing-liskov-db83d0.netlify.com/recipes/minty-chocolate-avocado-mousse/</link>

      <guid>https://laughing-liskov-db83d0.netlify.com/recipes/minty-chocolate-avocado-mousse/</guid>
      <description>I’ve been playing around with this recipe for a while. Avocados are a great source of monounsaturated fat and fibre, and also contain a wide variety of nutrients, including 20 different vitamins and minerals.
Knowing that they are super nutrient dense I find it frustrating that it’s hard to get anyone in my house to eat more than a smear of it on a sandwich.</description>

      <title>Yummy Balls! Chocolate Peanut Butter Bliss Balls</title>

      <description>I love Snickers bars. That irresistible combination of peanut and chocolate together!
Well here is my healthier version with mostly raw ingredients. They are still a treat, and have a high sugar content, but if you are looking for a higher calorie snack to take on a trail run or to give to the kids as an after school snack these could be a great go-to.</description>

      <description>We all like to have a bit of Christmas cheer and we don’t want to be a party pooper on the day. Life is for living after all!
But there are a few easy things that we can do that can help us feel better and minimise the impact of our indulgences during the holidays, so we don’t get to January and wonder what went horribly wrong.</description>

      <title>Gluten Free Meatballs</title>
      <link>https://laughing-liskov-db83d0.netlify.com/recipes/gluten-free-meatballs-and-burger-recipe/</link>

      <guid>https://laughing-liskov-db83d0.netlify.com/recipes/gluten-free-meatballs-and-burger-recipe/</guid>
      <description>Inspiration for this recipe came from wanting to have more meaty snacks for my kids to eat when they are hungry and hanging around the kitchen asking ‘What can I eat?’. This used to result quite often in a 100% carby snack which drives me a bit bonkers when you are trying to provide the little cherubs with a balanced diet of protein, fat as well as all the carbs that we eat in the typical Australian diet.</description>

      <description>I picked up this recipe a fews years back from Sarah Wilson’s I quit sugar website, but have put a bit of a twist on it by adding in cacao for extra antioxidants and chocolate flavour. I eat it for breakfast or even as an evening snack if I get the munchies and personally pair it with Greek full-fat yoghurt but it would be great with kefir or a coconut yoghurt too.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been making these bliss balls for a really long time and they are well loved in our house - even with my kids who both proclaim to not like dried fruit - I must admit I&amp;rsquo;ve never really told them what&amp;rsquo;s in them, just that they taste like peppermint chocolate and that is good enough for them!</description>

      <description>This is a great option if you are looking for a healthier alternative when that 2.30pm feeling for something sweet really hits. You can make this recipe as a plain ‘chocolate’ with no chunky ingredients, and if you do it only takes 5 minutes to combine the ingredients.</description>

      <description>I worked out this recipe to try and get a few more good fats into the family. Walnuts, parmesan, olive oil and ghee all have great fats in them that help with cell membrane integrity, good brain health and hormone creation.</description>

      <title>Why a low-fat or poor fat diet can be dentrimental to our health</title>
      <link>https://laughing-liskov-db83d0.netlify.com/blog/new-fats/</link>

      <guid>https://laughing-liskov-db83d0.netlify.com/blog/new-fats/</guid>
      <description>The majority of people today eat a diet low in fat or high in rancid or hydrogenated fats. On a cellular level, why is a low-fat or “poor fat” diet detrimental to health?
At a cellular level, lipids are the building blocks for both cellular membranes and hormones.</description>

      <guid>https://laughing-liskov-db83d0.netlify.com/recipes/chicken-bacon-and-roasted-veg-soup/</guid>
      <description>I came up with this recipe whilst trying to dream up a way of increasing the amount of prebiotic foods in my diet, which is important when you are avoiding gluten as people tend to reduce the amount of fibre in their diet when they are going gluten-free.</description>

      <title>How stress and chronically elevated cortisol disrupts the balance of hormones in your body</title>

      <guid>https://laughing-liskov-db83d0.netlify.com/blog/why-stress-throws-your-hormones-out/</guid>
      <description>So to start with, what is cortisol?
Cortisol is known as the fight or flight hormone, and is released by the adrenal glands in times of high stress and/or emergency. In Hunter-Gatherer times, the ‘fight or flight’ response was activated when fleeing from a dangerous situation, such as being chased by a wild animal.</description>

I’m passionate about improving health through nutrition, eating whole foods and a variety of herbs and spices to maximize health and longevity, whilst having fun and enjoying life along the way.</description>
